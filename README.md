# Tabs Demo

This demo is built initially in an attempt to try out mimicking the tab display similar to that on Github repository page.

Later I figured the tabs is a good place to introduce a feature with different implementations.

And then I learnt about the awesome 'React-Select' package. That's how it came to this final project.
